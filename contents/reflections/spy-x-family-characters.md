### Forger family[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spy_%C3%97_Family&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Forger family")]

* Twilight (黄昏, *Tasogare*) / **Loid Forger** (ロイド・フォージャー, *Roido Fōjā*)

  * Voiced by: [Takuya Eguchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takuya_Eguchi "Takuya Eguchi")[\[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_%C3%97_Family#cite_note-Anime-2) (Japanese); Alex Organ[\[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_%C3%97_Family#cite_note-Dub-3) (English)
  * An unnamed [spy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy "Spy") from Westalis with extraordinary combat, memory, and information processing capabilities. Being a master of disguise, "Loid" uses various faces and names for each mission, though he is generally known by his code name, "Twilight." His most recent mission, Operation Strix, requires him to enroll a child in the prestigious Eden Academy to approach a prominent figure in Ostania's warmonger political party. Hence, he camouflages himself as "Loid Forger", a psychiatrist at Berlint General Hospital, to create a false family by adopting Anya and marrying Yor, ignorant of their true identities. Loid possesses a vast amount of talents and skills, in espionage and in real life. Although he appear to be manipulative and pragmatic, he from time to time reveals his soft side and shows himself to be a good person to his fake family. Formerly a war orphan, he became a spy to create a "world where children do not cry."
* Thorn Princess (いばら姫, *Ibara Hime*) / **Yor Forger** (ヨル・フォージャー, *Yoru Fōjā*)

  * Voiced by: [Saori Hayami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saori_Hayami "Saori Hayami")[\[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_%C3%97_Family#cite_note-Anime2-4) (Japanese); Natalie Van Sistine[\[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_%C3%97_Family#cite_note-Dub-3) (English)
  * A 27-year-old professional [assassin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin "Assassin") nicknamed "Thorn Princess," disguising herself as an employee at Berlint City Hall. Yor's [maiden name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiden_name "Maiden name") before marrying Loid is Briar (ブライア, *Buraia*). She agrees to a fake marriage without knowing Loid's true background needing a cover identity for her assassinations and believes that Anya is Loid's actual daughter from a previous marriage. Yor is extremely strong and tough, as she can kick a speeding car approaching her and survive bullet wounds and lethal poison. Yor is good at cleaning due to the nature of her work, but not with the other household chores, particularly cooking, resulting in Loid doing most of the cooking; though she strived to improve that herself. In her assassination mission, she is ferocious and intimidating to the point of beast-like appearance. Away from her mission, Yor is a caring, soft and formal spoken and considerate to others; she is also an airhead and absent-minded. She has a younger brother named Yuri, a civil servant, who is a bit too attached to her and whom Yor is unaware is actually in the Secret Police.
* Anya Forger (アーニャ・フォージャー, *Ānya Fōjā*)

  * Voiced by: [Atsumi Tanezaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atsumi_Tanezaki "Atsumi Tanezaki")[\[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_%C3%97_Family#cite_note-Anime2-4) (Japanese); [Megan Shipman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Shipman "Megan Shipman")[\[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_%C3%97_Family#cite_note-Dub-3) (English)
  * A young girl who can [read minds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telepathy#Thought_reading "Telepathy"), Anya is the only one who knows the overall situation of her family, but conceals her true nature for fear of abandonment. She appears to be around age four or five but claims to be six as Loid needed to adopt a six-year-old as part of his mission. Originally an experimental human test subject dubbed "Subject 007" (被検体007), she escaped because she was frustrated with a life where she could not behave like a child. She named herself "Anya" and had been adopted by several families only to be returned to the orphanage each time. Due to her ability, Anya is not good with crowds, and because Anya has not received a proper education, she is not good at studying and makes up for it by reading other peoples' minds for answers she needs. However, she cannot use her psionic ability during a [new moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_moon "New moon"). Her favorite food is peanuts, likes the spy-themed cartoon *Spy Wars*, and thinks anything involving "secrets" and "missions" are exciting.
* Bond Forger (ボンド・フォージャー, *Bondo Fōjā*)

  The family's pet [Great Pyrenees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrenean_Mountain_Dog "Pyrenean Mountain Dog"), Bond was originally Project Apple's canine test subject named "Subject 8" (8号, lit. "Number 8"). He can [glimpse the future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precognition "Precognition"), which is known and utilized only by Anya through her telepathy. He meets Anya and the Forger family when used in a terrorist bomb attack. Thanks to his ability, he made contact and protected Anya, unknowingly saving Loid's life. He later was adopted into the Forgers. He displays his unconditionally love and loyalty to the Forgers, and is especially close to Anya. He is resistant and hesitant to any form of training because of his past in Project Apple. He dreads Yor's cooking after his future sight once showed him that it could kill him, and goes to great lengths to avoid that. He was named after Anya's favorite cartoon character in *Spy Wars*, Bondman.
